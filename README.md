## Introduction
This server-side project aims to build a data API for a supermarket stock management database. 
This API is for a fictional warehouse which contains stock batches of particular items. Products in stock can be sorted into a list of ordered items, that is then added to an order placed by a supermarket.

1. Add products to the stock database.

2. Remove products to the stock database.

3. Update products in the stock database to show the change in stock.

4. Display all items in the stock database.

5. Filter Items in the stock database based on their properties. E.g. (showing items that only exist in the dairy aisle)

### Extension Key Function
